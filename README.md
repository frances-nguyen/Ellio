# EllioAndroid

This is an infinite runner game where player gets to take control of the alien named Ellio. In the game, the character will run infinitely without 
player control. As blocks scroll from the right side of the screen, the player will need to react 
accordingly by sliding and jumping to avoid them. Each time the player is hit by a set of blocks, Ellio will
be pushed slightly left. Once Ellio has been pushed completely off the screen, the game will end.
